Hello! The following explains what order to run the files in 
https://github.com/nmmacdo/econ771-assignment-1-small.git to replicate my work
for assignment 1. This is a smaller version of my original assignment-1 repo
and does not contain the raw HCRIS, POS, or ACS Medicaid data, only the 
processed forms. 

Step 1: Perform the analysis.

Step 1 requires you to run one file in 'analysis' to analyze the data pulled
from GitHub as described in the 'Resources and Data' section at
https://econ771f22.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com/assignments/exercise1.html.

1. Run main.R to complete the analyses required for assignment 1. In an ideal
world, this would run Callaway_SantAnna_DiD_with_Rambachan_Roth_honest_DID.R
as well.

Step 2: Compile the results.

I have not fully automated the creating and saving of tables and plots, so edit
and save the tables and plots as necessary and transfer into Overleaf/LaTeX for 
manuscript preparation.
